# C0D3_V1B3 - Simple Django Blog

A sleek, programmer-themed blog platform built with Django and simple web technologies. This project features a clean, responsive design with syntax highlighting, Markdown support, and interactive UI elements - all implemented without JavaScript frameworks.

**FYI: This is a sample personal project I created in order to actually learn Django.**

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

C0D3_V1B3 follows a clean architecture pattern with Django's MVT approach:

- **Models**: Defined in `blog/models.py` with clear relationships
- **Views**: Class-based views with a custom mixin for shared functionality
- **Templates**: Organized in `templates/` directory with inheritance
- **Static Files**: CSS and JavaScript in `static/` directory

### Design Patterns

- **Mixin Pattern**: `BlogContextMixin` provides common context data to all views
- **Class-Based Views**: Leveraging Django's generic views for common operations
- **Template Inheritance**: Base template with blocks for specialized content
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first CSS with media queries

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend**:
  - Python 3.x
  - Django 5.2
  - SQLite (easily switchable to PostgreSQL for production)

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML5 & CSS3
  - Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
  - No frameworks or dependencies

- **Markdown Processing**:
  - django-mdeditor for editing
  - django-markdownify for rendering

- `templates/blog/post_detail.html` - Single post view
- `templates/blog/category.html` - Category archive

### Static Files

- CSS: `static/css/style.css`
- JavaScript: `static/js/main.js`

### Color Scheme

The site uses a Monokai-inspired color palette defined as CSS variables in `static/css/style.css`.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Developer Notes

### Code Organization

- **views.py**: Contains view classes and the shared context mixin
- **models.py**: Defines the database structure
- **admin.py**: Customizes the admin interface
- **urls.py**: URL routing configuration

### Design Decisions

- Used Django's class-based views for maintainability and DRY code
- Implemented a custom mixin to share common context data across views
- Used vanilla JavaScript instead of frameworks for better performance and fewer dependencies
- Implemented responsive design with a mobile-first approach
- Chose Markdown for content to keep the focus on writing and code presentation

### Future Improvements

- User authentication for comments (currently anonymous)
- Social sharing functionality
- Search functionality
- Related posts feature
- Tag system in addition to categories
- RSS feed for subscriptions
